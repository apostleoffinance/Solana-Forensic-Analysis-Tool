## 🧠 Project Overview

This project provides a complete investigative toolkit for analyzing Solana transactions and entities, combining real-time data ingestion, machine learning clustering, and interactive visualization.

**End Deliverables:**
- ✅ Deployed tool with fraud detection & wallet visualization
- ✅ Comprehensive forensic analysis report
- ✅ Finalized GitHub repository with API docs and usage guide
- ✅ Social media-ready findings and case studies

---

## 🗓️ Project Timeline

### Week 1: Research & Setup
- Studied Solana on-chain data structure
- Defined database schema (wallets, transactions, labels)
- Built data ingestion pipelines using Helius, Vybe, and Dune APIs

### Week 2: Transaction Flow Mapping & Wallet Analysis
- Implemented transaction graph using NetworkX
- Developed wallet explorer module with funding traces
- Built filters for wallet address, time range, and amount

### Week 3: Clustering & Entity Labeling
- Clustered suspicious behavior using DBSCAN
- Built entity label dataset from Vybe & Dune
- Created APIs to expose labeled addresses

### Week 4: Deployment & Documentation
- Deployed via FastAPI and Vercel (Next.js)

## ⚙️ Features

### ✅ Transaction Flow Mapping  
Visualize how funds move across wallets.  
- Directed graph (nodes = wallets, edges = flows)
- Supports filters (by token, date range, volume)

### ✅ Wallet Analyzer  
Analyze a wallet’s behavior and connections.  
- Full transaction history
- Funding source tracking
- Activity summary

### ✅ Clustering Engine  
Identify suspicious patterns at scale.  
- Graph-based DBSCAN clustering
- Pattern detection (e.g., layering, wash trading)

### ✅ Entity Labeling  
Know who’s who on-chain.  
- Tags from Vybe and Dune
- Exchange, Mixer, DAO, Scam Wallets, etc.

## 📊 Forensic Report Highlights

- Traced stolen funds from [Case Study A] through multiple mixers to exchanges.
- Identified wash trading clusters in [Protocol B].
- Labeled 1,200+ unique addresses using Vybe and Dune intel.
- Flagged high-risk wallets with ties to past exploits.
